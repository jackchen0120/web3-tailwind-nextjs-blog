# Web3 Tailwind Nextjs Blog

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Version 2 is based on Next App directory with [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.

Check out the documentation below to get started.

## Motivation

I wanted to port my existing blog to Nextjs and Tailwind CSS but there was no easy out of the box template to use so I decided to create one. Design is adapted from [Tailwindlabs blog](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/blog.tailwindcss.com).

I wanted it to be nearly as feature-rich as popular blogging templates like [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules) but with the best of React's ecosystem and current web development's best practices.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone the repo

```bash
npx degit 'timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog'
```

2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use
   other analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.
4. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)
5. Modify `projectsData.ts`
6. Modify `headerNavLinks.ts` to customize navigation links
7. Add blog posts
8. Deploy on Vercel

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

Please note, that if you are using Windows, you may need to run:

```bash
set PWD="$(pwd)"
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in `app` or content in `data`. With live reloading, the pages auto-updates as you edit them.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - tailwind configuration and stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`contentlayer.config.ts` - configuration for Contentlayer, including definition of content sources and MDX plugins used. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then use them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link, `next/image` component, table of contents component and Newsletter form are passed down. Note that the components should be default exported to avoid [existing issues with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51593).

`layouts` - main templates used in pages:

- There are currently 3 post layouts available: `PostLayout`, `PostSimple` and `PostBanner`. `PostLayout` is the default 2 column layout with meta and author information. `PostSimple` is a simplified version of `PostLayout`, while `PostBanner` features a banner image.
- There are 2 blog listing layouts: `ListLayout`, the layout used in version 1 of the template with a search bar and `ListLayoutWithTags`, currently used in version 2, which omits the search bar but includes a sidebar with information on the tags.

`app` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## Post

Content is modelled using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), which allows you to define your own content schema and use it to generate typed content objects. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter follows [Hugo's standards](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Here's an example of a post's frontmatter:

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)â€™s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**

1. Add `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`. See [static exports documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration) for more information.
2. Comment out `headers()` from `next.config.js`.
3. Add `unoptimized: true` to the `images` key in `next.config.js`:

   Alternatively, to continue using `next/image`, you can use an alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai. See [image optimization documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) for more details.

4. Remove `api` folder and components which call the server-side function such as the Newsletter component. Not technically required and the site will build successfully, but the APIs cannot be used as they are server-side functions.
5. Run `yarn build`. The generated static content is in the `out` folder.
6. Deploy the `out` folder to your hosting service of choice or run `npx serve out` to view the website locally.

**Note**: Deploying on Github pages require addition modifications to the base path. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.
